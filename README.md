## A description of what the project is for.

This should answer a short list of basic questions:

* **What is this repo or project?** (You can reuse the repo description you used earlier because this section doesn’t have to be long.)
* **How does it work?**
* **Who will use this repo or project?**
* **What is the goal of this project?**  
<!-- I enjoy training machine learning models, finding features in data, and building nice looking graphs. I also like to analyze data using statistical methods to validate hypotheses. Roughly speaking, I am in love with Data Science)

I regularly participate in Data Science hackathons and programming competitions, attend conferences and meetups on data analysis.

In my free time, I go in for sports, watch films in English, read scientific books and articles. And I just like to have a good time with friends)
